## Context Notes

Key decisions and context for resuming:

- **Scope**: Complete system redesign from scratch (not incremental improvement)
- **Architecture**: Modern microservices with event-driven communication
- **Philosophy**: Cloud-native, scalable, cost-effective
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months full rebuild
- **Approach**: Build new system in parallel, migrate gradually
- **Tech Stack**: Python (backend), Flutter (mobile), TypeScript (web admin), PostgreSQL + MongoDB, Kubernetes
- **Modules**: 10+ microservices identified

## Fork History

N/A - Master architecture specification

## Next Actions

1. Complete master architecture requirements document
2. Create individual SDD flow for each microservice
3. Define inter-service contracts (APIs, events)
4. Plan database schemas and data flow
5. Design deployment architecture (Kubernetes)
6. Create migration plan from current system
